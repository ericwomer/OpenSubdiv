    Editing the navigation tab
    --------------------------
    
    Edit the file 'nav_template.txt'. It is injected by the python script
    'processHtml.py' in the HTML generated by rst2html (docutils).
    
    Note: html comments will be stripped (removes the license text)



    Inserting content in <head>
    ---------------------------
    
    Edit the file 'rst_template.txt' and add HTML in the %(head) section (see 
    the "favicon" link for reference). Other sections can be similarly accessed.
    

    Diagrams
    --------
    
    Use diagrams.odg in OpenOfficeDraw to edit the new diagrams. Use the export
    function to generate bitmaps in the images/ directory.
